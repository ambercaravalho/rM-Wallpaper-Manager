# rM-Wallpaper-Manager

A simple utility to assist in managing the wallpapers (or splash screens) on reMarkable devices.

## Overview

This tool allows you to customize the splash screens (wallpapers) that appear on your reMarkable tablet, including startup, shutdown, battery empty, and other system screens.

## Requirements

- A reMarkable tablet (reMarkable 1, reMarkable 2, or reMarkable Paper Pro)
- Your reMarkable tablet connected via USB on your computer
- SSH password (found in `Settings > About > Copyrights and licenses > GPLv3 Compliance`)

### Some Notes

| For reMarkable Paper Pro  | Security Note |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| You must enable Developer Mode to access SSH and run this script: `Settings > General > Developer options`.  | For reMarkable 2 or Paper Pro, it's recommended to enable full device encryption: `Settings > Security > Data Protection > Security Level`  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These actions will wipe your entire device. Be sure to either backup your device or sync with reMarkable Connect before continuing!

## Using the Wallpaper Manager on Your reMarkable

After installation, connect to your reMarkable through SSH:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_REMARKABLE_IP
```

Once connected via SSH, run the following commands:

1. Navigate to the `rm-background-manager` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/root/rm-background-manager
   ```

2. Install the wallpapers (first-time setup):
   ```bash
   bash install.sh
   ```

3. For future wallpaper updates (after changing the PNG files):
   ```bash
   bash update.sh
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Can't connect to reMarkable**: Verify that developer mode is enabled (if supported) and that your tablet is displayed as a network device on your computer.
- **Permission denied errors**: Make sure you're using the correct password from your device settings.
- **Wallpapers not showing up**: Verify that your images are PNG files, that they are properly named, and that they are placed in the custom-backgrounds folder.
- **Changes not appearing**: Reboot your reMarkable tablet after installing or updating wallpapers.

## Reverting to Default Wallpapers

The install script creates backup files with ".bak" extensions. To restore the original wallpapers, connect via SSH and move these files back:

```bash
cd /usr/share/remarkable
mv batteryempty.png.bak batteryempty.png
# Repeat for other wallpaper files
```

# rM-Wallpaper-Manager

A simple utility to assist in managing the wallpapers (or splash screens) on reMarkable devices.

## Overview

This tool allows you to customize the splash screens (wallpapers) that appear on your reMarkable tablet, including startup, shutdown, battery empty, and other system screens.

## Requirements

- A reMarkable tablet (reMarkable 1, reMarkable 2, or reMarkable Paper Pro)
- Your reMarkable tablet connected via USB on your computer
- SSH password (found in `Settings > About > Copyrights and licenses > GPLv3 Compliance`)

### Before We Begin

| For reMarkable Paper Pro  | For reMarkable 2 |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| You must enable Developer Mode to access SSH and run this script: `Settings > General > Developer options`  | I'd *strongly* recommended enabling data encryption: `Settings > Security > Data Protection > Security Level`  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both these actions ðŸ‘† will wipe your entire device. Be sure to either backup your data directory or sync with reMarkable Connect before continuing!

## Using the Wallpaper Manager on Your reMarkable

After installation, connect to your reMarkable through SSH:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_REMARKABLE_IP
```

Once connected via SSH, run the following commands:

1. Navigate to the `rm-background-manager` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/root/rm-background-manager
   ```

2. Run the wallpaper manager script:
   ```bash
   bash wallpaper-manager.sh
   ```

3. Choose from the available options in the menu:
   - Option 1: Install Custom Wallpapers (creates backups of original files)
   - Option 2: Update Wallpapers (reinstalls after system update, creates backups)
   - Option 3: Restore Original Wallpapers (restores from backups)
   - Option 4: Exit

> [!WARNING]
> After every reMarkable software update, the device resets custom wallpapers to defaults.
> You'll need to SSH back into your tablet and run the wallpaper manager script again using Option 2 (Update Wallpapers). You don't need to repeat the computer-side setup.

## Troubleshooting

- **Can't connect to reMarkable**: Verify that developer mode is enabled (if supported) and that your tablet is displayed as a network device on your computer.
- **Permission denied errors**: Make sure you're using the correct password from your device settings.
- **Wallpapers not showing up**: Verify that your images are PNG files, that they are properly named, and that they are placed in the custom-backgrounds folder.
- **Changes not appearing**: Reboot your reMarkable tablet after installing or updating wallpapers.
- **After reMarkable update**: Use Option 2 in the wallpaper manager to reinstall your custom wallpapers.

## Reverting to Default Wallpapers

The installed wallpapers can be reverted to default in two ways:

1. Using the wallpaper manager script (Option 3)
2. Manually restoring from backup files:

  ```bash
  cd /usr/share/remarkable
  mv batteryempty.png.bak batteryempty.png
  # Repeat for other wallpaper files
  ```
